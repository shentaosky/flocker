Flocker Documentation
=====================

Welcome to the Flocker docs! If you're just getting started with Flocker, it might be worth reading our :ref:`introduction`, or trying our simple tutorial on the `Getting Started with Flocker`_ page.

In the documentation listed below, you'll be able to find instructions on how to install, configure, and use Flocker.
You will also find instructions on how to install and use :ref:`docker-plugin`.

You'll be able to find concept and reference material, and our :ref:`Labs section<labs-projects>` contains all the information you need about our experimental projects.

Flocker is an open-source project, and in our :ref:`Getting Involved section<getting-involved>`, there is information about how you can collaborate with ClusterHQ.
