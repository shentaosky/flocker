Flocker with Compose
====================

With the :ref:`docker-plugin`, and with Compose support for the ``volume_driver`` field, you can use Flocker together with Docker Compose.

First, you need to :ref:`install Flocker <labs-installer>` and the :ref:`docker-plugin`.
You can use our experimental  :ref:`Flocker Installer <labs-installer>` to do this.

Then, you need a version of Compose that supports Flocker volumes.

Run the following command to do this (this branch that will be installed corresponds to `this pull request <https://github.com/docker/compose/pull/1502>`_):

.. prompt:: bash $

    sudo pip install git+https://github.com/lukemarsden/compose.git@volume_driver

docker-compose.yml
==================

To make use of Flocker volumes with Compose, you will need to specify a ``volume_driver`` field in your ``docker-compose.yml`` file.

Here is an example of a simple application that has 2 containers ``web`` and ``redis``.  Notice how the ``redis`` container has a data volume and has the ``volume_driver`` field set to ``flocker``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    web:
      image: binocarlos/moby-counter
      links:
        - redis:redis
    redis:
      image: redis
      volume_driver: flocker
      volumes:
         - 'demo:/data'

Note that ``demo`` here corresponds to the name given to the Flocker plugin.
The name will show up in the Flocker dataset metadata.

docker-compose up
=================

Once you have a ``docker-compose.yml`` file that has a ``volume_driver`` field,
you can run a ``docker-compose up`` command as you would normally.

.. prompt:: bash $

    docker-compose up -d

Data Volume Format - Standard
=============================

When you use Flocker to manage data volumes with Compose the format of the data volume is slightly different than normal Docker volumes.

For a normal Docker volume - you would provide the ``host path`` and ``container path`` as a composite value - here is an example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    redis:
      image: redis
      volumes:
         - '/var/lib/redis:/data'

In this example ``/var/lib/redis`` is the host path and ``/data`` is the container path.

Data Volume Format - Flocker
============================

For a Flocker managed volume - you still provide the container path but instead of a host path, you provide a global name for the volume.

Here is the same example as above but in place of ``/var/lib/redis`` we provide a global name for the volume.

.. code-block:: yaml

    redis:
      image: redis
      volume_driver: flocker
      volumes:
         - 'demo:/data'

In this example - we have asked Flocker for a volume named ``demo``.
Flocker will automatically migrate the volume to the host where Docker is running and mount the volume.

Also check out the `DockerCon Plugin Demos <https://plugins-demo-2015.github.io/>`_ site to see a joint project between ClusterHQ and Weaveworks.
This is the "ultimate integration demo" â€” a pre-built demo environment that includes Flocker, Weave, Swarm, Compose & Docker, all working together in harmony.
