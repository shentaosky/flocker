Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Which operating systems are supported?
**************************************

Flocker manages Docker applications and Docker runs on Linux, so Flocker runs on Linux.
However, you do not need to be running Linux on your development machine in order to manage Docker containers with the ``flocker-cli``.
See :ref:`supported-operating-systems` for a list of supported operating systems.

How does Flocker integrate with Kubernetes / Mesos / Deis / CoreOS / my favorite orchestration framework?
****************************************************************************************************************

.. spelling::

   de
   facto

Over time, we hope that Flocker becomes the de facto way for managing storage volumes with your favorite orchestration framework.
We are interested in expanding libswarm to include support for filesystems and are talking with the various open source projects about the best way to collaborate on storage and networking for volumes.
If you'd like work with us on integration, get in touch on our Freenode IRC ``#clusterhq`` or `the Flocker Google group`_.
You can also submit an issue or a pull request if you have a specific integration that you'd like to propose.

Security
~~~~~~~~

I think I've found a security problem! What should I do?
********************************************************

If you think you've found a security problem with Flocker (or any other ClusterHQ software), please send a message to security@clusterhq.com.
Your message will be forwarded to the ClusterHQ security team (a small group of trusted developers) for triage and it will not be publicly readable.

Due to the sensitive nature of security issues, we ask you not to send a message to one of the public mailing lists.
ClusterHQ has a policy for :ref:`reporting-security-issues` designed to minimize any damage that could be inflicted through public knowledge of a defect while it is still outstanding.
